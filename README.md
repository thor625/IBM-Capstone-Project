# IBM Capstone: SpaceX Landing Prediction

## Portfolio Snapshot
- Score: **5.8 / 10**
- Verdict: **Keep only as coursework evidence**
- Category: End-to-end data science capstone

## Project Summary
A multi-notebook capstone analyzing Falcon 9 launch data and modeling first-stage landing success.

## What It Does
- Collects launch data from SpaceX API
- Scrapes supplemental launch information from web sources
- Performs wrangling, EDA, SQL analysis, and mapping
- Trains and compares classification models

## Model Results (Notebook Output)
- Logistic Regression accuracy: **0.8196**
- SVM accuracy: **0.8196**
- Decision Tree accuracy: **0.8750**
- KNN accuracy: **0.6643**

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- requests, BeautifulSoup
- matplotlib, seaborn, Folium

## Repository Contents
- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb`
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`
- `labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling-v2.ipynb`
- `jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz-v2.ipynb`
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`
- `lab-jupyter-launch-site-location-v2.ipynb`
- `SpaceX-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Part-5-v1.ipynb`

## Run Locally
1. Install notebook dependencies (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `folium`, `requests`, `bs4`, plotting libs).
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run in order from data collection and wrangling to model prediction notebook.

## Why This Scores Here
- Good breadth across the DS lifecycle
- Largely guided course lab content, so weaker as a differentiated portfolio centerpiece

## Improvement Priorities
- Consolidate into one polished narrative report
- Refactor notebooks into reusable scripts/modules
- Add one custom extension (feature engineering or interpretability)
